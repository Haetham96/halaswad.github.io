I am a PhD student, working under the the supervision of Cécile PIERROT and Emmanuel THOMÉ  in the team CARAMBA at LORIA in Nancy, France.

I focus on studying the Discrete Logarithm problem, specifically in non-prime finite fields (with extension degree greater than one). My research contributes to improving the Number Field Sieve algorithm and its variants in both theoretical and practical aspects.


### Ongoing work


I currently work with Cécile Pierrot and Emmanuel Thomé on a new Shirokauer map that allows using Galois automorphisms in the Tower Number Field Sieve. we have exciting results that lead to significant accelerations in the linear algebra step. The work will be made public soon.





### Research interests:


I am interested in computational number theory, especially the lattice word!
